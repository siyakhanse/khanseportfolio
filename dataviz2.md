General government debt

SUMMARY:

Federal debt is an amount of money that a country has borrowed and needs to pay off at some point. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits (OECD, n.d.). Gross domestic Product (GDP) is the total of all value created in an economy. The debt-to-GDP ratio is a metric that compares a country’s public debt to its GDP. It’s generally measured in percentage and the formula is as follows: Debt-to-GDP = Total debt / Total GDP of a country

Essentially, the debt-to-GDP ratio is an indicator of how strong or weak a country’s economy is and what its ability to pay off debts is. In the event a country is unable to pay back it’s debt, the risk of defaulting increases(Kenton, 2022). As a result, it may lead to financial panic in domestic and international markets.


A high ratio suggests a country isn’t producing enough to pay off its debt (Amadeo, 2022). Conversely, a low ratio suggests the country has an abundance of economic output to pay for what it has borrowed. Therefore, its ideal to have a low debt-to-GDP ratio and that’s what governments strive for. 


However, this is hard to achieve in times of financial or civil unrest. It’s natural for governments to temporarily borrow funds from external sources to fulfil immediate needs, but also stimulate growth and boost aggregate demand (Kenton, 2022). 


As per a study conducted by the World Bank, countries whose debt-to-GDP rations exceed 77% for prolonged periods experience significant slowdowns in economic growth. Every percentage point increase of debt above this level costs countries 0.017 percentage points in economic growth. This phenomenon is even more aggravated in developing economies, where each additional percentage point of debt over 64% annually slows growth by 0.02% (Amadeo, 2022).


The graphs below show the debt-to-GDP ratios and economic trends of over 40 countries and may be prove to be an important tool in understanding the correlation between multiple variables such as dependence of certain countries on others, recession, impact of wars or even a global pandemic on the economic health of nations.
