**FINAL PROJECT- PART 3**
----

**SUMMARY:**

While deciding the topic of my project I knew I wanted to shed light on the topic of Veganism. But it was confusing for me to narrow it down to a topic it correlates with. Veganism is more popularly discussed when talking about climate change, health, and animal cruelty. But more recently there’s a growing awareness about the link between factory farming and zoonotic diseases that cause outbreaks like the one we are experiencing currently, antibiotic resistance and even structural racism in the food system. Each of the topics I mentioned above deserves a presentation of its own and there is an overwhelming amount of data based on these. I finally chose to create my final project that focused on exploring the link between global warming and animal agriculture. 


**DESIGN & NARRATIVE:**

In terms of design decisions, I was clear about the way I wanted to show the most important data. I had one visualization that compared different types of foods and the carbon emissions associated with each one of them. There was one that compared the carbon footprint based on different dietary lifestyles. And finally, a 3rd creative visualization that showed the impact of implementing even the smallest change.

Since I picked up different techniques of data visualizations in this class, I decided to add a few more visualizations/creative ways to tell the story, rather than simply making it a text-heavy project. I want to talk about my ideation and execution behind this one particular visualization that I used 3 images for. It shows how much of the rainforests are being deforested every second on an average. When you scroll in that section on shorthand, it takes about a second to fully see the overlapping effect of the three images- the first one has full forest cover, second one is partially deforested and the last one is fully cleared out.  My thought behind creating that was to show that by the time you’re done scrolling that part, in actuality, the amazon forests have lost that much of forest cover. Finally, in support of my 3rd visualization that showed the impact of implementing even the smallest change, I made a visualization on Canva that compared the carbon emissions of food to cars and air pollution. 


**AUDIENCE:**

I was apprehensive about the topic from the start as this topic often is misinterpreted and isn’t well-received. Based on my user research and discussion with peers (predominantly meat eaters), I decided to use a tone as understanding and relatable as possible. I didn’t want to make anyone feel attacked. I understand one cannot force decisions; that will never accomplish change.  The ideal audience for this project is anyone and everyone. But my hope is for it to resonate most with people who sincerely practice other sustainable habits. I have therefore, embedded URLs to 3 of my most trusted resources for those who choose to act on it. Based on my personal experience, I know it touches base on every element of adopting a plant-based lifestyle.


**NOTE ABOUT CITATIONS:**

I've sourced most of my data from organizations like [Cowspiracy](cowspiracy.com) and [Meatless Mondays](https://www.mondaycampaigns.org/meatless-monday) that have worked on compiling multiple datasets from government organizations. Apart from that, I have included other citations wherever necessary.
