**FINAL PROJECT- PART 1**
----

**OUTLINE:**

Each one of us complains about climate change until we realise we are ultimately the ones in control- of preventing it or further worsening it. 
As a reader I want to be aware of my role in global warming so I can make better, informed choices about sustainable eating and living. 

Call to action- Incorporating more plant-based foods in our diets


**DATA SOURCES:**
I have identified multiple sources of data for my project- USDA, Oxford Academic, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sicences of the United States of America and IOP Science.
The links are as follows

While the aforementioned links provide the raw data needed, I will refer to additional sources such as Meatless Monday, PETA, Plant Based News, etc anddocumentaries like Seaspiracy that have tied this data together as I work towards the execution of the project.


**INITIAL SKETCHES:**

**STRUCTURE:**
ACT 1/BEGINNING:
I will begin by showing beautiful photo/video snippets of the Amazon Rainforest, Coral Reefs, Biodiversity, and other important ecosystems that are directly impacted by global warming.

ACT 2/MIDDLE:
I will then shed light on what global warming has done to the environment- the rate of reduction in forest cover, extinction of species, and bleaching of coral reefs. I will then show the forecast for 2025, 2040 and 2050. When the situation becomes dire enough, I will proceed towards a solution.

ACT 3/ENDING:
I will then propose a solution after the prompt- "what if the single-most effective solution in tackling tehse issues was one simple lifestyle change that you can all make?"
Before revealing the solution I will again show the forecast for 2025, 2040, amd 2050 IF THE SOLUTION WAS IMPLEMENTED and compare it to the previous stats. 
Then I will reveal the solution- going plant-based once a week. I will mention my personal journey of going from a voracious meat-eater to a vegan and how it has positively impacted my health as well. 

I will then go a step further by making a data visualization that compares the stats of no change,  going plant-based once a week, thrice a week and that of a vegan diet. 
The last step is to encourage anyone who is willing to consider a plant-based lifestyle more seriously. The comparisons of the carbon emissions/ forest cover/ etc in all 4 scenarios will give the reader a perspective of the link between food consumtion and global warming. 

**MEDIUM:**
I will be showcasing my final project using Shorthand.
