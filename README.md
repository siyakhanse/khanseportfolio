Welcome all! This was a part of my Telling Stories with Data assignment. Through this class, I had the opportunity of working on some cool projects that you can find below. 

# About me
Thanks for stopping by. I'm Siya (she/her). I'm a communication designer doing my master's in entertainment industry management from Heinz College, CMU. I'm currently working as the Head of Marketing for Carnegie Mellon University's International Film Festival. My job entails developing marketing strategies, generating campus and city-wide awareness with the help of campaigns and events, and overlooking the design and social media teams. I also work with Carnegie Mellon University's official Marketing and Communications team as a content creator. In the past, I've worked multiple roles in the realm of brand-building, graphic design, and video production.

I am passionate about working on design-oriented solutions. I'm a quick learner, and I quickly adapt to new surroundings and situations. I love collaborating with people and making new friends. So if you find my introduction interesting, hit me up on my email- skhanse@andrew.cmu.edu

# What I hope to learn
In this class I hope to learn how to make compelling data visualizations. In the future, I'd like to work in the realm of marketing, strategy and business development.
